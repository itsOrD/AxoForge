# Project Scaffold Intent (The Source of Truth)

> **AI Directive**: This file is the **DNA** of the project. Read this FIRST.
> All other documentation (tech_stack.md, pipelines, rules) must be hydrated from the decisions made here.

## 1. Project Objective
*   **Goal**: [Describe the high-level goal, e.g., "Build a high-performance verified email service"]
*   **Target Audience**: [Who is this for?]
*   **Key Value Proposition**: [Why does this exist?]

## 2. Technology Stack (The "What")
*   **Language**: [e.g., Python 3.12, TypeScript 5.4, Go 1.22]
*   **Framework**: [e.g., FastAPI, Next.js, Gin]
*   **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis]
*   **Infrastructure**: [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda]

## 3. Architecture Style (The "How")
*   **Pattern**: [e.g., Modular Monolith, Microservices, Event-Driven]
*   **Communication**: [e.g., REST, gRPC, GraphQL]
*   **Auth Strategy**: [e.g., OAuth2, JWT, Session]

## 4. Engineering Priorities (The "Values")
*   [ ] **Velocity**: Ship fast, break things (Startup Mode).
*   [ ] **Stability**: 99.99% Uptime (Enterprise Mode).
*   [ ] **Security**: Zero Trust (Fintech/Health Mode).
*   [ ] **Scalability**: Handle 1M+ users (Hyper-scale Mode).

## 5. Development Defaults
*   **Linter**: [e.g., ruff, biome, golangci-lint]
*   **Test Runner**: [e.g., pytest, vitest, go test]
*   **Package Manager**: [e.g., pip/uv, pnpm, go mod]
